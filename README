# Crypto Technical Analysis Bot for Beginners

Beginner friendly crypto trading assistant that turns raw price charts into clear **BUY / SELL / NO-TRADE** ideas.

## What it does

- Connects to real exchanges using `ccxt` and pulls live OHLCV candles.
- Computes classic technical indicators like EMA, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
- Detects basic market regimes (uptrend, downtrend, range, choppy).
- Runs a predefined library of TA strategies:
  - Trend following continuation setups.
  - Breakout style entries.
  - Range trading mean reversion ideas.
  - Simple RSI momentum filters.
- Produces structured trade signals with entry zone, stop loss, and take profit levels.
- Uses an **LLM powered explainable AI layer** to generate **human readable justifications** for each signal.

This project is designed as an **educational and decision support tool**.  
It is not financial advice and does not guarantee profit.

## Architecture overview

- **LLM powered explainable technical analysis for beginners.**
- **Human readable trade rationales powered by large language models.**
- **AI assisted regime detection and strategy selection.**
- Modular Python package with:
  - `bot/data` for exchange integration and local persistence.
  - `bot/indicators` for indicator and feature engineering.
  - `bot/strategy` for opinionated strategy implementations.
  - `bot/engine` for market regime detection and strategy orchestration.
  - `bot/backtest` for simple bar by bar backtesting and sanity checks.
  - `bot/api` for FastAPI endpoints and JSON responses.
  - `bot/ai` for LLM based explanations.

The design is **container ready** and easy to extend into full **MLOps style pipelines** in future versions.
